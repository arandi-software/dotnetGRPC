Following the tutorial described by Microsoft Here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/grpc/grpc-start?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio

I have enhanced the solution to have a fully functional gRPC Client & Server built with .NET 8 preview and Docker.

Server solution contains 2 docker files: one for building the images as standalone and one to be used with Docker Compose.

Please feel free to use the appropriate Docker file.

If you need any help in running the Docker Containers, please feel free to contact me at office@arandi.software

Feel free to use this code, enhance it and create commercial projects with it.

Enjoy !

P.S. - I have created the solution using .NET 8 for MacOS and VS Code. I have included the VS Code generated files if anybody needs them.
